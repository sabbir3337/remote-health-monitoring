# ðŸ©º AI Medical Detection System

An AI-powered medical detection system designed to predict diseases based on clinical data using machine learning algorithms. This project demonstrates how AI can assist healthcare professionals in early disease diagnosis and improve patient outcomes.

## ðŸ“Œ Features

- Predicts medical conditions (e.g., Diabetes) based on patient health metrics.
- Uses Logistic Regression for classification.
- Can be extended to other diseases and models (like deep learning for image-based detection).
- Simple, clean, and easy-to-understand codebase for beginners and researchers.

## ðŸš€ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook / Python script
- (Optionally) TensorFlow or PyTorch for future extensions

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The project uses the [Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv), which includes medical records of female patients and a binary outcome indicating the presence or absence of diabetes.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-medical-detection.git
